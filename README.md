### About the repo

This demonstrative website was created from scratch as a part of the Live Coding session hosted by Codecademy on April 28, Thursday.

The original solution is hosted by Dan Ordille on [GitHub](https://github.com/dordille/threadly). This repo was forked from the same.

The original solution used Bootstrap and jQuery for development. I rewrote the project using vanilla CSS and JavaScript as an exercise.

### Why 'vanilla'fy?

I believe frameworks and libraries make us lazy. Of course they are useful in real projects, but for those who are learning to code, it is crucial to get thorough with the core. That means pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Period.

### Does it work?

It works fine on Safari 8 on Mac OS X and the built in browser for Android running CyanogenMod 13. Haven't tested on other platforms.

So far I haven't added any vendor specific prefixes to any CSS properties, so the rendering might be inconsistent in some (older) browsers. I haven't added any documentation to the code either, might add it soon.

##### Credits
Thanks to Dan and Codecademy for the session, it was great fun! It is still live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Q6aUPfqkM) for anyone to watch. :)
